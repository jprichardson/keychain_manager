Ruby Gem Mac OS X Keychain Manager
----------------------------------

This gem aids your ruby scripts by providing access to the Mac OS X Keychain Access.

Purpose
^^^^^^^

I needed a way to generate 100+ Apple push notification certificates for my iOS apps. Using the
Mac OS X command `security`, I was able to automate the generation of certificates. This gem
simply wraps `openssl` and `security` command line utilities.

As of now, this gem only contains code relevant to the generation of keys and certificates for 
iOS development. Of course, this could easily be expanded to include other areas.



Testing
